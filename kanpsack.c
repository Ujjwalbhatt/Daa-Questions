// // Given a knapsack of maximum capacity w. N items are provided, each having its own value and
// weight. You have to Design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find the list of the
// selected items such that the final selected content has weight w and has maximum value. You can
// take fractions of items,i.e. the items can be broken into smaller pieces so that you have to carry
// only a fraction xi of item i, where 0 ≤xi≤ 1
